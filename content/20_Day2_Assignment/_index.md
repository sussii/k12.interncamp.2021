#### Get Familiar with AWS Products

First, let's have an overview of AWS. Browse through [AWS Official Webpage](https://aws.amazon.com/). 

* [What is Cloud Computing](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/?nc1=f_cc)
* [AWS Cloud Products](https://aws.amazon.com/products/) 

In this two weeks, you will use three AWS Products. 

 * [Amazon WorkSpaces](https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/) is used as a host to run the python project.
 * [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) is used for running the given Notebooks, where you learn algorithms step-by-step.
 * [Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/) is used for accessing quantum computing resources.

### Run Notebook in Amazon SageMaker


**Step 1**  : After logging into your AWS console and search for "SageMaker”, then click to open the Amazon SageMaker panel.

**Step 2** : Next, let us create a notebook instance.

**Step 3** Select Instance type. SageMaker provides multiple instance types of different computational power and prices. When creating an instance, we can specify the instance name and choose its type. we choose ml.c5.2xlarge. With 8-core CPU, this instance is powerful enough for most of our chapters.

**Step 4** Checkout the given GitHub Repo. A Jupyter notebook version of this book for fitting SageMaker is available at https://github.com/. We can specify this GitHub repository URL to let SageMaker clone this repository during instance creation.

**Step 5** It may take a few minutes before the instance is ready. When it is ready, you can click on the “Open Jupyter” link.

**Step 6** After finishing your work, do not forget to stop the instance to avoid extra cost.

### Quantum Computing in the Industry

Let's look the quantum technology from IBM
