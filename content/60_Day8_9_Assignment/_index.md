#### Get Familiar with AWS Products

First, let's have an overview of AWS. Browse through [AWS Official Webpage](https://aws.amazon.com/). 

* [What is Cloud Computing](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/?nc1=f_cc)
* [AWS Cloud Products](https://aws.amazon.com/products/) 

In this two weeks, you will use three AWS Products. 

 * [Amazon WorkSpaces](https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/) is used as a host to run the python project.
 * [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) is used for running the given Notebooks, where you learn algorithms step-by-step.
 * [Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/) is used for accessing quantum computing resources.

### Setup Development Environment


**Step 1**  : Download workspace client from https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/.

**Step 2** : Log into Amazon WorkSpaces with the given registration code. (If you don't have the code, ask your mentor.)

**Step 3** : After login, you will see the desktop user interface. Now you are using a Amazon Linux system.

**Step 4** : Open a Terminal window.

**Step 5** : Execute the following commands in the Terminal to checkout project GitHub Repository and start running the project.
```
git clone  https://github.com/guming3d/TSP-workshop-Original.git
cd TSP-workshop
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 source/flask_app.py
```
**Step 6** : Open a web browser in the WorkSpace, visit http://127.0.0.1:5000, you should see a Web UI.

### Research about TSP Applications

Let's do some background research. Find at least 5 real-world problem related to TSP. You should be able to describe the use cases.

### Onboarding to Quantum Computing

We will try to solve TSP problem with quantum computing(QC) resource in the second week. Today, we hope you get a basic concept of QC. 

* What is Quantum Computing? 
* Is Now the Right Time for QC? (30mins)
