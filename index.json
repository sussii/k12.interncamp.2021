We prepared some very challenging but exciting tasks for you. Are you ready for this intense journey?\nDeep Breath\u0026hellip;\nIf the answer is yes. Then, let\u0026rsquo;s go!\nFirst of all, here is the framework for the journey\n Learn a classic problem called Traveler Salesman Problem(TSP), which is always taught in Computer Science class. Understand how the TSP problem maps to real-world problems. Dive deep into different algorithms to solve the problem. Learn the concept of Quantum Computing Learn how to leverage Quantum Computing to solve the same problem  Each day you will be given an assignment, please follow the guide step-by-step. We know that some of the tasks are not easy for the students at your age. If you get stuck somewhere, first, discuss with your teammates. Trust us, teamwork always helps. In the case, everyone gets stuck, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to find your mentors. We are always behind and provide assistance.\nCheckpoint  Office Hour: From Day1 to Day9, there is 30 mins session for Q\u0026amp;A. There is a leadership principle in Amazon: Learn and Be Curious. During the daily session, feel free to express your concerns or through questions to your mentors. Pregress Check Meeting: From Day1 to Day9, at the end of day, you will give a lille demo (PPT slids or code samples) to show your work of the day. We will have some casual conversations with you making sure that your understanding is correct and comprehensive. Final Presentation: On Day10, You will work as team to give a formal presentation to the invited reviewers and audience. Tips: Dresscode = Formal  "},{"uri":"https://sussii.github.io/k12.interncamp.2021/10_day1_assignment.html","title":"Day1 Assignment","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Day1 Assignment Day1 is for ramping up.

SageMaker provides multiple instance types of different computational power and prices. When creating an instance, we can specify the instance name and choose its type. we choose ml.c5.2xlarge. With 8-core CPU, this instance is powerful enough for most of our chapters.\nStep 4 Checkout the given GitHub Repo. A Jupyter notebook version of this book for fitting SageMaker is available at https://github.com/. We can specify this GitHub repository URL to let SageMaker clone this repository during instance creation.\nStep 5 It may take a few minutes before the instance is ready. When it is ready, you can click on the “Open Jupyter” link.\nStep 6 After finishing your work, do not forget to stop the instance to avoid extra cost.\nRead through the Notebooks Please read through the Notebook carefully.
